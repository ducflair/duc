// SCHEMA_VERSION=2.0.0

/**
 * Official FlatBuffers Compiler: https://flatbuffers.ar.je/
 * Official FlatBuffers Documentation: https://flatbuffers.dev/tutorial/
 *
 * To maintain backward compatibility when evolving FlatBuffers schemas, follow these guidelines:
 *
 * - **Should be fine to rename fields**
 * - **Add new fields at the END of tables**: This ensures older code can still read the data without issues.
 * - **DONT REMOVE FIELDS**: Instead of deleting unused fields, mark them as deprecated to prevent their use in new code while maintaining compatibility with existing data.
 * - **DONT CHANGE FIELD TYPES**: Modifying a field's type can lead to incompatibilities. If necessary, add a new field with the desired type and depreciate the old one.
 * - **BE CAREFUL WITH DEFAULT VALUES**: Changing default values can cause inconsistencies when reading older data. It's best to set appropriate defaults initially and avoid altering them.
 * - **STRING or TABLE CANNOT FALLBACK TO NULL**: these fields cannot be null. They already have a default null value.
