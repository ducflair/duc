Our roadmap outlines the future development plans for the `duc` file format and its associated tools and applications. This document provides a high-level overview of the key milestones and features that we aim to achieve in the coming years.

### Project Goals
- **Provide a 2D CAD canvas as a `React Component`**
  - Enable developers to easily integrate a versatile 2D CAD canvas into their React applications.
  - Offer customization options to tailor the canvas to specific project needs.
- **Develop a new 2D CAD file format called `Duc`**
  - The Duc format is lightweight, text-base, and easy to manipulate programmatically.
- **Promote innovation by `enabling community contributions`**
  - Create a welcoming and inclusive environment for developers and designers to contribute to the project.
  - Encourage the development of plugins, extensions, and additional tools to enhance the core library and file format.
- **Empower individuals in designing the future world**
  - Democratize access to powerful CAD tools, reducing reliance on proprietary systems.
  - Foster a community-driven approach to CAD tool development, ensuring the project evolves to meet the needs of its users.
