- The main canvas is based on Excalidraw's canvas, which is a virtual whiteboard where you can draw shapes, add text, and move things around.
- We have made some modifications to the original Excalidraw canvas to make it more suitable for our use case.

<Callout icon={"🏗️"}>
  We plan on documenting these changes in the future.
