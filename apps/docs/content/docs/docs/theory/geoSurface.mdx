The Geometric Surface is a dynamic, interactive canvas that forms the core of our design application. It's a virtual space where precision and creativity come together, allowing designers and engineers to conceptualize, visualize, and manipulate design elements with unprecedented accuracy and flexibility.

<Callout type="info">
  This Paradigm is just a term to describe the infinite surface where the user can draw, zoom in and out, and move around.

## Infinite Geo Surface

Just imagining a Graph above makes things a lot easier

- The dead center position of the canvas will be (0,0)
- And it is ok to have negative positions such as (2,-3) or (-2,-4), because this is what makes the graph infinite, is the fact that the possibilities within this are infinite.

### Pre-Rendered Area

- To improve performance, pre-render areas just outside the viewport. This can be managed by determining which elements fall within this extended area and rendering them in advance.
