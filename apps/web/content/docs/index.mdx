## Overview

The `duc` file format is a cornerstone of our advanced design system, conceived to cater to professionals seeking precision and efficiency in their design work. It integrates seamlessly with [Ducflair's CAD Application](https://ducflair.com), leveraging the power of modern computing and graphical rendering technologies. This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the format's structure, capabilities, and integration with various applications.

The `Core Library` and file format are a fork from [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) at the [v0.17.3 Version](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/releases/tag/v0.17.3), we thank them for the amazing work they invested, it gave us a great base to build on top of.

## Purpose and Scope

- Providing a CAD Open-Source platform for future generations to build upon.
- High-precision and detailed design work, particularly in fields requiring CAD-level accuracy.
- Enabling dynamic rendering and manipulation of design elements on a morphing geometric surface.
- Serving as a bridge between traditional design data storage and real-time graphical applications.

## Key Features

- **Structure Flexibility**: leveraging `JSON` as the base format, `duc` files are highly flexible and can be easily integrated into various applications. And this opens the door for `AI` to be used in the future.
- **Dynamic Zoom Levels**: `duc` files support a unique zooming mechanism that allows for a fluid transition between different unit scopes, from macro to micro scales.
- **Infinite Graph Surface**: The format is designed to work with an infinite canvas, offering boundless space for creativity and design.
- **Integrated Theming and Styling**: `duc` files accommodate dynamic theming, allowing users to switch between various visual styles seamlessly.
- **Layered Design Elements**: The format supports 3 layers of design elements, Notes, Loose and Precise, each with its own set of properties, editing and rendering rules.


## Intended Audience

This documentation is intended for software developers, designers, and CAD professionals who wish to understand the `duc` file format in detail and utilize it in their applications or workflows.
