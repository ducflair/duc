## How it works

A `.duc` file is a standard **SQLite database**. `ducrs` wraps it with a typed, idiomatic Rust API.

## Installation

Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ducrs = "*"
```

## Basic Usage

```rust
use ducrs::DucFile;

fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let doc = DucFile::open("drawing.duc")?;
    for element in doc.elements()? {
        println!("{:?}", element);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```
