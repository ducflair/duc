## Installation

```bash
pip install ducpy
```
or 
```bash
uv add ducpy
```

## Basic Usage

The `ducpy` package provides Python types and utility functions to work with the `duc` CAD file format. Here's a quick overview of how to use it:

```python
# Import the ducpy package
import ducpy as duc

# Parse a duc file
with open('example.duc', 'rb') as f:
    duc_data = duc.parse.parse_duc_flatbuffers(f)

# Access elements, app state, and files
elements = duc_data['elements']
app_state = duc_data['appState']
files = duc_data['files']

# Serialize a duc file
with open('output.duc', 'wb') as f:
    duc.serialize.serialize_to_flatbuffers(elements, app_state, files, f)
```

## Package Structure

The `ducpy` package is organized into the following main modules:

- **parse**: Functions for parsing duc files and converting to Python objects
- **serialize**: Functions for serializing Python objects back to duc format
- **classes**: Python class definitions for duc entities
- **utils**: Utility functions for working with duc files

Each module provides specific functionality for working with different aspects of the duc file format.
