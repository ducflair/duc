  - **Enrich `CAD features` significantly**
    - Expand the library’s toolset to include more advanced CAD functionalities.
  - **Achieve `90% completion` of the file base format**
    - Finalize the `duc` file format, ensuring it can handle a wide range of CAD use cases and is robust enough for production use.
    - Conduct `extensive testing` to validate the format’s performance and reliability.
