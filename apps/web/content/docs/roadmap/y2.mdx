## Decide on making the project open-source at this stage based on several factors
  - **Market breakthrough**
    - Evaluate the project’s market reception and user adoption during private beta or internal testing phases.
    - Determine if there is significant interest and demand from the broader community for an `open-source 2D CAD library` and `file format`.
  - **Quality and readiness of the file and library**
    - Ensure that the `duc` file format and the `associated libraries` are mature, stable, and feature-complete.
    - Gather feedback from initial users to refine and improve the library and file format.
