## Work privately at Ducflair to get the library usable
  - **Build on top of `Excalidraw`**
    - Utilize `Excalidraw’s` existing infrastructure and features as the foundation for `Ducflair’s 2D CAD library`.
    - Adapt and extend `Excalidraw’s` functionality to suit the specific needs of a 2D CAD system.
  - **Implement dedicated mechanisms**
    - Develop unique tools and functionalities tailored for CAD purposes.
    - Integrate these tools seamlessly with the existing Excalidraw-based framework.
  - **Ensure the file format looks mostly complete**
    - Design and define the `duc` file format.
    - Create comprehensive documentation for the Duc file format to facilitate future development and contributions.
  - **Start private implementation of the `Python library`**
    - Begin developing a Python library that can read, write, and manipulate `duc` files.
