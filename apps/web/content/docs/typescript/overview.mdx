## How it works

A `.duc` file is a standard **SQLite database**. `ducjs` compiles to WebAssembly and uses
an embedded SQLite engine so it works in Node.js, Deno, Bun and the browser without any
native dependencies.

## Installation

```bash
npm install ducjs
# or
bun add ducjs

# or any other JavaScript package manager
```

## Basic Usage

```ts
import { DucFile } from 'ducjs';

const doc = await DucFile.open('drawing.duc');
const elements = await doc.elements();
console.log(elements);
```
