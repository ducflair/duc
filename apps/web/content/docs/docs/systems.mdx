### Metric System
- **Widely used globally**, except in a few countries.
- Measurements are based on meters, centimeters, millimeters, and so on.
- Preferred in fields like engineering, architecture, science, and most manufacturing sectors outside of the United States.
- Offers ease of calculation and conversion due to its decimal-based structure.

### Imperial System
- **Predominantly used in the United States** and to some extent in the United Kingdom (though the UK has officially adopted the metric system, some industries still use imperial measurements).
- Measurements include inches, feet, yards, and miles.
- Commonly used in construction, real estate, and many manufacturing sectors within the United States.
- Differs from the metric system in terms of the number of units and the conversion factors between them.
