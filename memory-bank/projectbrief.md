# Project Brief

## Purpose
The `duc` project defines an open-source, cross-platform 2D CAD file format and supporting libraries. It aims to provide a modern, efficient, and extensible foundation for professional design workflows, enabling seamless integration with cloud-based and automated CAD/PLM solutions.

## Core Requirements and Goals
- Provide a robust, open 2D CAD file format based on Flatbuffers for performance and compatibility.
- Support bindings and utilities for TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, and Rust.
- Enable precise, efficient manipulation and rendering of CAD data.
- Integrate with modern design systems and platforms (e.g., Scopture).
- Maintain strong type safety and developer ergonomics.
- Foster community adoption and contributions under the MIT license.

## Scope
- Core file format definition (schema/duc.fbs).
- Language bindings and utilities: ducjs (TypeScript), ducpy (Python), ducrs (Rust), ducpdf, ducsvg, ducdxf.
- Web-based documentation and playground.
- Example applications and integration guides.
