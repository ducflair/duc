# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Establishing and documenting the Memory Bank for project context and continuity.
- Ensuring all core documentation files reflect the current state and goals of the duc project.

## Recent Changes
- Initialized the Memory Bank directory and all core markdown files.
- Populated projectbrief.md and productContext.md with repo-specific content.

## Next Steps
- Complete detailed documentation for systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, and progress.md.
- Keep Memory Bank files updated as the project evolves and new features are added.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Use Flatbuffers as the serialization backbone for the duc format.
- Maintain language bindings for TypeScript, Python, and Rust.
- Prioritize extensibility and performance in all design decisions.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- Strong typing and schema-driven development.
- Modular, cross-language architecture.
- Open-source, community-driven approach.

## Learnings & Project Insights
- Clear documentation and context tracking are essential for cross-language, multi-package projects.
- Automated and cloud-based workflows are increasingly important in CAD/PLM environments.
