# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The `duc` project was created to address the lack of a modern, open, and extensible 2D CAD file format suitable for integration with cloud-based, automated, and cross-platform design workflows. Existing formats are often proprietary, limited in extensibility, or poorly documented.

## Problems It Solves
- Lack of an open, well-documented 2D CAD file format for professional use.
- Difficulty integrating CAD data across different languages and platforms.
- Inefficient or legacy serialization formats that hinder performance and interoperability.
- Barriers to automation and cloud-based workflows in CAD/PLM environments.

## How It Should Work
- Developers use the schema (Flatbuffers) and language bindings (TypeScript, Python, Rust) to read, write, and manipulate duc files.
- The format supports advanced CAD features, strong typing, and efficient serialization.
- Integration with web-based tools, documentation, and playgrounds for rapid prototyping and learning.
- Designed for extensibility and easy adoption in both open-source and commercial projects.

## User Experience Goals
- Fast, reliable, and precise CAD data manipulation.
- Seamless integration with modern development environments and CI/CD pipelines.
- Clear, accessible documentation and onboarding.
- Consistent experience across all supported languages and platforms.
