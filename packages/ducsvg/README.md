# ducsvg

`ducsvg` is a lightweight adapter for rendering `duc` CAD documents to SVG. Itâ€™s built on top of `ducjs` and focuses on accurate, standards-compliant SVG output you can embed in browsers or export from Node.js.

- Convert duc files to SVG strings
- Strongly typed with TypeScript

> A more realistic approach to `ducsvg` would be to use `PDF.js` from mozilla in combination with the `ducpdf` library to convert the duc to PDF and then to SVG so that we have a more modular and robust solution.
