Downloads & Installation
========================

Install from PyPI
-----------------

The recommended way to install ducpy:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install ducpy

Install from Package Index
--------------------------

You can also install ducpy directly from our package index hosted on GitHub Pages:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install ducpy --extra-index-url https://ducflair.github.io/duc/simple/

This is useful for accessing pre-release or platform-specific builds that may not
yet be published to PyPI.

Direct CDN Access
-----------------

All wheels are served directly from GitHub Pages, so you can also fetch them via CDN:

.. code-block:: text

   https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ducflair/duc@gh-pages/simple/ducpy/<wheel-filename>

This is particularly useful for Pyodide and other browser-based Python runtimes.

Browse Packages
---------------

See all available wheels and source distributions in the
`Package Index <https://ducflair.github.io/duc/simple/ducpy/>`_.
